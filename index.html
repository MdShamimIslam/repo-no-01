                <h1>Now is the time to stand beside the helpless flood-hit people</h1>
                <p>The flood situation in Sylhet and Sunamganj has reached alarming proportions due to torrential
                    downpours and steep slopes. Due to heavy rains in Meghalaya-Assam of India, the third phase of the
                    current flood season has occurred in the Sylhet region due to the water coming down from the upper
                    reaches. Residents of the region are devastated by one flood after another. Millions of people in
                    the two districts are under water. Many important installations have also been seriously flood
                    heated.

                <h1>How to Survive a Flood</h1>
                <p>
                    Floods can strike quickly and with little warning in many parts of the world. Surviving a flood is a
                    combination of preparation and appropriate action as soon as the disaster begins. Prepare yourself
                    for a flood by packing an emergency kit and finding shelter. Stay away from water and stick to high
                    ground during the flood. Afterwards, cautiously return home. Disinfect and repair affected areas so
                    you’ll stay safe even after the water is gone.
